## hi, i'm [aul! 👋

i'm a cs student at the university of calgary who likes building things with code 🧑‍💻 and breaking problems down with data 📊. i’m especially into software engineering, data science, ml/ai, and how tech connects to bigger themes like geopolitics, security, and global power 🌍.

this github is where i experiment, learn new tools, and ship random projects!
